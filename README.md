# This is a project on wrangling data. Data was wrangled from three datasets.

All datasets contain data from a Twitter account called WeRateDogs. Some of the data pulled is in JSON format and other data is in csv format. It was merged together after a lengthy assessment and cleaning process.

The files were then combined into one and some insights gathered. The insights can be found in the "Act_Report". A summary of the wrangling process can be found in the file "Wrangle_Report".
